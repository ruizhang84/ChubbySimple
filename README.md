# ChubbySimple
A simple Implementation of Chubby

- This project is a simple implementation of chubby, which includes a paxos algorithm and an api to call the chubby services.
- It also includes two test cases, where test1 provides an example of api usage,
and test2 shows how servers (continuously) run even if there are some unavailable services.
